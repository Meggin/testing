# Roadblocks to revenue
Imagine that your product looks amazing; everything is working smoothly and the reviews are good, yet the revenue stream is low. There could be roadblocks that prevent users from spending money in your app. A roadblock could be a design issue that discourages users; for example, a complex registration process or a technical issue on particular devices.

When you find you need to optimize your monetization model, analytics tools are your best friend. Reports can help you drill down and identify elements of your product that aren't performing as they should. Let's take a look at some specific examples.

###Screens report

Use the Screens report to compare the monetized and non-monetized segments to see if users who don't spend money have a higher exit rate on certain screens. This could indicate that there is a roadblock on that screen, like an extra-challenging level in your game or a technical issue in the shopping cart. In both cases, you'll want to check these issues on a regular basis and provide help to your users to avoid them.

###Event Tracking report

Run an Event Tracking report to see whether non-monetized users are leaving your product after a specific interaction. Perhaps a particular event, such as a share button or extra time required to load new content, is frustrating some users or blocking them from reaching the in-app store to make purchases.

###Devices report

Examine the Devices report and, if you see that monetization is lower on one device compared to others, test to see if there are any technical issues with your app on that particular device.

###Crashes and Exceptions report

Use the Crashes and Exceptions report to identify possible roadblocks. Crash data is automatically sent to your reports, but you can also define exception types for more detail on other errors, such as network failures and empty search results. The data can be broken out by app version, operating system, and device brand, so you can evaluate your app's technical performance in different environments.

You can even measure how much crashes are costing you! You can do this by creating two segments, one for sessions with crashes and another without. Then compare the e-commerce conversion rate and average order value of the segments to see if these metrics are lower in sessions with a crash.

###Loyalty report

The Loyalty and Recency reports can show user interest in your app based on how frequently and recently users re-open the app in a given time frame. It's a great way to recognize the users who *love* your app vs. the ones who just *like* it.

In the Loyalty report, we can see the number of sessions, average session duration, number of screens per session, and the goal conversion rate, broken out by how frequently users have returned to your app.

At the conversion rate trend in the Loyalty report, we can see that users with fewer than three sessions have lower conversion rates. It's possible that this set of users encountered technical roadblocks or didn't find the app compelling enough to return. You may want to try to use advertising to motivate less-loyal users with free promotional credits or other incentives early on. 

If you want to identify reasons users aren't returning regularly, you could create a segment of users who visited infrequently and investigate whether they share any common attributes. For example, these users may have come from a marketing campaign that's bringing in the wrong audience. You could also investigate the similarities that more loyal users share and market the app to comparable users.

###Recency report

The Recency report is similar to the Loyalty report, except that it shows how much time passed between app sessions. With this report, you can plan promotions or app updates based on how frequently users re-open the app. 

For example, if you compare two date ranges and see a change in how frequently users return to your app over time, you might consider building a fresh user experience like adding new game levels or a new in-app store.
