# Lesson 3: Optimize Your Model

##Overview
In this lesson, you'll learn how to optimize your monetization model if you find that it's not performing as well as you expect. The ability to quickly react to change is one of the advantages you have over big companies.

Your goal is to tailor a monetization solution to fit your users. In this lesson we will see how to improve your process to reach this goal.

##Understanding your users' needs
Harnessing habits leads to more revenue by driving a higher customer lifetime value (LTV) and giving you greater flexibility with pricing. If you can create a consumer habit for your app it will supercharge your monetization plan. Think, for example, about a toothbrush use case &mdash; once or twice a day is a good rule to start with.

Start by identifying the four product aspects: *triggers, actions, rewards*, and *investments*. This is called the "hooked model"; let's explore it a bit.

###The hooked model

*Triggers* are points where users open your app. It's a good place to start, because you can't make money if people aren't using your product. In order to improve your triggers, think of the following questions:

 - Who is your user? If you have more than one type of user, try to identify each.
 - What are they doing just before they decide to interact with your product?

*Actions* are those behaviors that result in rewards. Here, youâ€™ll want to optimize your model to alleviate a pain point and get users to interact with your app. Ask yourself the following questions: 

 - Where is the most challenging action?
 - How can you test and improve it?

>**Hint:** Analytics play a huge role in finding answers that are based on data. Take a minute to jot down how you might use analytics to help identify these roadblocks.

*Rewards* are forms of gratification your users get these for performing actions. The most important question here is:

 - How are your rewards structured to make users want more?

*Investment* doesn't necessarily refer to money; time and effort are also investments. Think about that TV show you continued to watch long after the plot soured because you had invested so much time in it already. 

 - How does your product ensure that users come back?
