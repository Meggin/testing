# Lesson 1: Monetization Strategies

##Overview
In this lesson, we'll look closely at what you need to know to monetize your app. By the end, you will be able to develop an implementation plan for the model relevant to your product.

This lesson covers a variety of methods; bear in mind that they may not all be applicable to your product. 

##Review of monetization models
Let's review some of the highlights of the most popular models.

###Advertisements
Serving advertisements provides a way to make money while giving your content or app for free. Ads are very popular, both in web pages and in native applications.

###One-time charges
This model is similar to visiting a shop and paying a set price for a product. You can do it in two different ways:

 - Charge a fixed price for your app at the moment the user wants to buy it
 - Charge a fixed price for your app after a trial period

In both cases, payment should be quick and easy, and not require the user to log in, and you should use a simple and established checkout provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.) so you don't waste time reinventing the wheel.

###Subscription 
Sometimes you want to sell your service on a monthly or yearly basis. The main advantage to this model is that you can earn more due to the increase in lifetime value of your users. Also, your users will feel comfortable because, in this pay-as-you-go model, they control the monetary outlay.

###In-app payments
This is a very popular model because it combines two big features: it provides free apps at the outset, and it's a great way to monetize your power users later.

##Research competitors
Before choosing a monetization model, it's a good idea to research how competing products monetize. Search for similar apps in online stores or, if you are on the web, do a search to see what your competitors are doing. What monetization methods are most used by your competitors? Try to analyze the numbers that make the business cash-flow positive.

You may need to download, or even purchase, your competitors' products to determine their monetization methods. Also consider "hidden competitors", those companies that are offering a different app or service, but are operating on a budget similar to your own. 

See what other companies are doing, and think about the pros and cons of their approaches.
