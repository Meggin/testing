# Introduction

This document set is a text-based version of part of the content covered in [this Udacity course on monetization (UD518)](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud518/l-4638318691/m-4673460336). Rather than a direct transcription of the video course, it is meant to be a more concise treatment of monetization principles and practices, using the course's original content as a base.

In this course, you'll learn basic monetization principles for a variety of products and services, how to implement these strategies, and how to track their effectiveness. The course assumes you are familiar with the basics of monetization and common terms such as *revenue*, *profit*, *cost of goods sold*, *margins*, etc.; if not, please review Lesson 1 of the video course referenced above. 

The remainder of this course consists of three lessons. 

In **Lesson 1**, we'll go into detail on some of the **monetization strategies** available for different types of products, with an eye toward finding a strategy that's relevant to your needs.

In **Lesson 2**, you'll develop and implement a **monetization plan** for the strategy you've chosen.

In **Lesson 3**, we'll cover **measuring and optimizing** the performance of your monetization strategy. We'll also talk about when it may be necessary to change your strategy.

The goal is to help you plan, implement, track, and adjust your monetization strategy in order to have a sustainable business.
