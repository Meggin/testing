This concludes the second lesson. Here are the main takeaways:

 1. Settle on which monetization method you want to use.
 1. Decide how you will initially implement your model.
 1. Develop and use a plan for tracking and measuring your model.
 1. Prepare a Plan B model in case the first model doesn't work.
