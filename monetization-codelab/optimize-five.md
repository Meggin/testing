# Interating for games

Iteration is a very specific process for most products. Entrepreneurs need to analyze data and act accordingly to improve their monetization model. Companies in the games industry seem to follow a few proven paths for increasing revenue.

 - Promote certain items at the right situation for the "heavy gamers". The challenge is to identify these players and to find the right situations.
 - Offer an item with a big discount only to potential paid users. The challenge is to segment these users and control the exposure of the discount.
 - Use ads to help monetize non-paying users. The challenge is to blend the ads and protect the experience so these users will still love the game.

## Guiding principles

Many different factors affect your omptimization decisions; here are some of the important principles to remember.

 1. Listen to your users &mdash; over the phone, through their comments, or by looking at reports. After you listen, move fast to correct and improve your models.
 2. Test new ideas and let the data inform your decisions. It's always best to base your action on real data and not just on opinions.
 3. Do your best to provide a quality solution for a real need. Users will agree to pay for something that creates value. 
 4. Build trust. User trust creates a win-win situation that will increase the  customers' LTV and make both you and your customers happy.
