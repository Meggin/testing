# Implementing other models

We've gone over some examples for monetizing using ads on both web and mobile. Implementation steps for the other methods are similar. For other methods &mdash; one-time charge, in-app payments, and subscriptions &mdash; you just need to set up your payment system, following the instructions on each of their sites. 

###Resources for setting up payments
For subscription, IAPs, and e-commerce products, your most important job is to set up a means for customers to give you money. Here are some resources to help you make an informed decision on how to set up your payment model.

####Third party payment providers
We mentioned that using an established payment provider is a great way to easily get up and running with monetization using a service that customers are already familiar with. Here are some popular options.

 - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
 - [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/home)
 - [WePay](https://www.wepay.com/)
 - [Amazon Payments](https://payments.amazon.com/home)

####Setting up in-app billing

For native apps, in-app billing is a great way to sell digital content to your users. Follow the links below for more information on setting up IAP on different platforms.

 - [Android](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/index.html)
 - [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/)
 - [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing)

After you've set up your payment method, it's time to set prices and monitor performance.
