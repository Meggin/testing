# Tracking success

After you implement a model, you must learn what works and what doesn't. It's important to get the hooks in place early so you can monitor performance later. Think about all the user actions and events that you might want to monitor, and set up your tracking code to collect them. 

If you have a substantial audience, it is a good idea to test your model on some percentage of your users and learn from it. A good way to do this is by using a method called *A/B testing*.

>If you want to learn more about A/B testing, see this [Udacity A/B testing course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257).

###Set up tracking with Google Analytics
Again, we recommend you follow the steps now to get things set up early. If you don't currently have a product you can track, then we recommend you read through the resources to familiarize yourself with the process and bookmark relevant resources to return to later.

####Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a free platform and service that gives web and app developers access to tools and data to study user interactions with their web page/app. We'll go into more detail on Google Analytics later, but if you want a sneak peek, here's how we'll track our model.

 - [Goals & Conversions](https://greenido.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/how-to-use-goals-and-conversions-in-google-analytics/)
 - [Custom Goals & Dashboards](https://greenido.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/measure-goals-with-google-analitics/)

####Tag manager and tracking

An important aspect of setting up tracking on your site is to use a tag manager. If you're not familiar with tag managers, [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FXbsCWsEi8&feature=youtu.be&t=12) covers the basics of Google Tag Manager.

For web apps, first set up [Google Tag Manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en&rd=1), then add tracking for [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en).

For mobile apps, first set up [Google Tag Manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/3127354?hl=en), then add tracking for [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/mobile).

>Two valuable resources for setting up tracking are [Create and customize Dashboards](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1068218?hl=en) and [Measure Goals with Google Analytics](https://greenido.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/measure-goals-with-google-analitics/).

###Other tracking solutions
Google Analytics, while extremely popular, is not the only analytics solution available to you. Other options include:

 - [mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
 - [appsflyer](http://www.appsflyer.com/)
 - [Amazon analytics](https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/apis/manage/analytics)
 - [Yahoo analytics](https://developer.yahoo.com/analytics/)
