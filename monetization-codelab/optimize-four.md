# Re-engaging users

If your data indicates that users have slowed down or stopped using your app, there are ways you can get them to re-engage. Just be cautious about the methods you choose, and ensure you're not overloading your customers with notifications or other interruptions. It's important to find the "golden path" and not overdo it.

>The Golden Path is discussed in part of Udacity's Product Design Course at about 3 minutes into [this video](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud509/l-4275169017/m-4328768558).

## Email marketing

With email marketing you can notify users about updates in the app or promotions that might get them to re-engage. When sending a marketing email to reengage users, keep the following principles in mind.

 - Study the habits of the segments that have disenagaged and customize your email messages based on their attributes
 - Keep the message personal
 - Include informative data on user habits

You can find some great examples of email marketing campaigns [here](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-examples-list).

## Push notifications

For mobile apps, push notifications are another option for re-engaging users. Much like email marketing, be sure your message has value. Users get many push notifications, and you don't want them to feel that your notification isn't worth their attention.

For example, you might want to send a push notification with an offer for a free month's subscription, or offer free in-app tools to users who haven't opened the app in awhile. Or, if you've included social sharing with your app, you could motivate lapsed users with a friendly competition that challenges them to beat their friends' high scores.

Here are some how-to guides for adding push notifications.

## Remarketing

Remarketing is a powerful tool that lets you target ad content to users who have already visited your website or app. These people have already seen your product and are familiar with what you offer, so you can use analytics software to track their behaviors. Once you understand their behaviors, you can create a new marketing campaign that will encourage this group of people to come back.

For example, if your app is a shopping list that allows a user to buy items online, you may notice a group of users who use the app, but never actually buy items. You analyze these users and notice they tend to add small commmodity items to their list. So, whenever you notice a user who follows this behavior, you can offer a discount for those commodity items to trigger people to buy them. You might even figure out a deal where these items can automatically get delivered to the user every month.
