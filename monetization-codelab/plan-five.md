# What if you still aren't making money?

Sometimes you implement a monetization strategy that looks great on paper, but after you gave it a chance you realize it is not making as much money as you expected. To find out why, you'll need to see what your users are doing when they interact with your site or app.

In the examples that follow, we will use Google Analytics. Of course, you can take the principles from our examples and use them with other tools. 

####Behavior reports

A behavior report shows the performance of your content and the actions your visitors take. It visualizes the path the users traveled from one page to another or from one event to the next. These reports can help you discover which content keeps users engaged and which doesn't, and can help identify other potential issues.

In the navigation pane, click `Behavior`, then click `Overview`.

The Overview gives you a high-level summary of users who interacted with your app content, including Views, Time, and the Total Number of Events that occurred during sessions. If you want to analyze a particular metric in more depth, you can use the `View full report` link at the bottom. 

Next, click Behavior Flow.

The Behavior Flow report shows the path that users travel through your app from one screen or event to the next. This can help you understand the order in which users experience your content so that you can structure it to keep them engaged.

####App speed
Performance and speed is something that users love! In order to see what your app's performance is like, you need to look at the speed report.

The App Speed report shows how long different requests take to load in your site/app. You may want to track how quickly the screens load for each level of your game, or how fast search results are returned. You can also toggle between versions of this report including Explorer, Distribution, and Map overlay.

In the Distribution tab, you can see the percentage of tasks that fall into each User Timing Bucket, which communicates how long it typically takes tasks in your app to be completed. You can gain a lot of information from this report. It can help you identify the tasks that irritate users so you can improve them.

>**Tip:** The app speed report is important enough to be put on the dashboard so you can see it on a daily basis. You can also compare captured versions over time to see if you are improving after each launch of a new version.

####Geo reports
Use the Geo reports to see who in the world is using your product. The Map Overlay tab shows the global distribution of Average User Timing, with darker shades indicating longer load times. This report can show if your app experiences performance issues in particular regions. This is particularly important if you are using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or are streaming content that depends on the geographical location of your users.
