# Monetization model differences

Monetization models can differ slightly depending on whether you're building a web or native app. 

###Monetizing an e-commerce site
When monetizing an e-commerce site, there are several principles to keep in mind. 

####Let users explore before they commit
Google and AnswerLab undertook a [research study](https://www.google.com/think/multiscreen/whitepaper-sitedesign.html) examining how a range of users interacted with a diverse set of mobile sites. One of the principles the study revealed is that requiring login or account creation too early in a site experience can be detrimental to conversion. In the real world, that would be like requiring customers to present ID before even browsing your shop.

####Let users purchase as a guest
Not all users want to create an account, even to make a purchase. Allow your users to buy as a non-registered "guest" to encourage conversion. You can find a good example of this technique [here](http://greenido.github.io/Product-Site-101/).

####Make it easy to finish on another device
Offer an easy way to save or share current information across devices. For example, you might provide a way for users to share items across social networks or to email a link to themselves or others directly within the site itself.

####Use existing information to maximize convenience
Take advantage of information you already have so that users don't have to enter data twice, or use third-party payment services to make conversion as easy as possible. For your registered users, remember and pre-fill their preferences; for new users, offer a third-party checkout service they may already use.

>Don't forget to take advantage of the powerful and simple AutoComplete attribute available in Chrome; it can make your user's experience a lot better. [Learn how here](https://greenido.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/auto-complete-attribute-will-improve-your-profit/).
