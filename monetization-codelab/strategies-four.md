# Monetizing native apps

Now let's move into the flourishing world of native apps. You may notice some similarities between what we just covered about web products, but there are some specific differences for native apps.

Consider what will be the best initial model for your app. Remember that the model is likely to change, and that's okay; you need to be agile and listen to your customers. 

###Monetize premium apps
In this model you sell your app for a fixed price. Because in many cases this doesn't generate enough revenue, you can optionally include ads or use in-app billing to sell additional features or content.

This model works great for certain categories, such as games for kids. You would use this model so the parents can pay for them up front. However, this model may limit your app's monetization potential, particularly in developing markets. You may be able to achieve greater revenue using the freemium, subscription, or advertising models.

###Monetize freemium apps
As we know, users are more likely to download free apps. Later, you can use several options to monetize them:

 - Use in-app payments to unlock more features. For example, Games like Clash of Clans or productivity apps like Evernote use it to provide a free tier.
 - Subscriptions for recurring services. It might be used progressively or expire after a period of time, such as a game booster or news subscription. For example, Pandora, Strava, FT, and Dropbox.
 - Another option to monetize your free app is to just leave it free and use it as marketing or enhancement for other product.

###E-commerce
You can sell physical goods (e.g., keychains, clothing, cameras, etc.) and services in your app to increase revenu. Examples include Etsy and Amazon.

###Advertising
Again, ads can be a way to earn more from your freemium, premium, and subscription apps. The question is: which model gets the best results for your app?
