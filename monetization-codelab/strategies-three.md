# Monetization model details

###Subscription models
Subscription models are popular because they offer a win-win situation. When you let users try before they buy, and then buy only what they need, it builds trust and increases the user's LTV.

You can either create your own subscription service from scratch, or you can use a third-party service that offers you the ability to manage the subscriptions. Companies that offer such services include [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), and [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/).

As with many make-or-buy decisions, it's generally preferable to use work already done by others. Making your own service uses a lot of your time and resources, and won't actually make your product better. Here are some things to focus on regarding subscription models.

 - Trial periods are an important benefit; you can limit the trial by time or by other metrics like the amount of content viewed.
 - Give users the flexibility to change subscription programs when their needs change.
 - It's good to have a limited number of options; too many options can reduce conversions.
 - It makes sense to allow users to pay only for what they use; avoid rounding up if possible.
 - Third-party subscription services give you many options to create free trails, customizing plans by user type.

>American psychologist Barry Schwartz argues in his book [The Paradox of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) that limiting the number of choices can greatly reduce anxiety for shoppers.

###Ad-based models 
Ads come in many forms: text, images, video, and interactive media. The power of ads comes from the fact that they are targeted to both the site's content and the site's audience.

You make *ad spaces* available on your site; advertisers bid to show their ads on your site, and the highest bid wins. You get paid when users click the ads.

This model works best when you have a high-flow traffic base, so you can focus on vertical offers that advertisers want to make to their users. For example, a finance or automotive site with many users will probably have higher CPM/eCPM than a site that focuses on hand-made pipes or antique toys.

####Advertising terms
Let's take a closer look at five common metrics used in ad-based apps. 

 - *CPC* is "cost per click". This is essentially how much an advertiser pays you if a visitor to your site clicks their ad. This is sometimes also called *PPC*, or "pay per click.)
 - *CPM* is a little tricky; it stands for "cost per thousand" views (where M is the Roman numeral for 1,000). CPM is how much you earn for every thousand views of an ad. This can also be referred to as *CPI*, or cost per impression.
 - *eCPM* is the "estimated cost per thousand" views, and is calculated by dividing your total revenue by the total views in thousands. eCPM is helpful when you're evaluating the performance of different ads on your site, and want to estimate how much you'll make as views increase.
 - *CTR* is "click-through rate". This metric measures how many users have actually clicked an ad. It is calculated by dividing the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions (or views), then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

####Types of ads
Some sites that use ads effectively include [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/), [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/), and [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/). In each case, the placement of the ads is carefully considered, and both the content and the format of the ads are targeted to the site's users.

 - *Banner ads* are image-based advertisements that often appear at the side, top, or bottom sections of websites. They use the CPC model, in which advertisers pay a fee each time a user clicks the ad.
 - *Display ads* are a form of contextual banner ads.
 - *Retargeting ads* attract the user to visit a site by taking into account the user's web history.
